# murmur-skill-create-manifest

Complete `murmur.yaml` schema reference — enables an agent to generate valid
capsule manifests from plain-language task descriptions.

Skill artifact (`runtime: skill`): no binary or WASM component, just the
[skill.md](./skill.md) guidance file, which the runtime installs to
`workdir/tools/<name>/skill.md` before the agent loop starts.
